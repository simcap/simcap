### Welcome 👋

🌱 For two decades, I've collaborated to create and launch robust, scalable software solutions across diverse teams and industries in global hubs including Sydney, London, New York, and Paris.

📡 My expertise extends to the security sector, where I provide defensive/offensive services, trainings and consultancy.

:triangular_flag_on_post: I am located in Paris. For full details, here is my [CV page](https://simcap.github.io/).

:teacher: For engineers, I created [original hands-on curriculum Go workshops](https://rekon.io/workshops/)

:link: For subscribers, I build my own products. Ex: the _Automated Infrastrucure Analysis_ product [Surface](https://surface.rekon.io/).
